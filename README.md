# L.LFO

> Max For Live advanced LFO Audio Effect device

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

The LFO is by far my favorite utility in production. I love the modularity of it.
When time came to get my feet wet with Max I had no doubts as to what my first
project would be. There are quite of few M4L LFOs out there, but in every case
there was something I didn't like, or a feature I didn't have.
For my own artistic needs I wanted something that was compact -
so I could route LFOs to LFOs and so on - all without having to navigate too much.
I also needed something that could produce more interesting waveforms than the
standard Sine, Triangle, Square, Saw, Noise. This I have accomplished
and then some.

## Features

+ **Classic Waveforms** -
  Sine, Triangle, Saw, Square, Random-Step,
  Random-Smooth (and more with ModCycle and SR modes listed below)
+ **Waveform Inversion** - make a Saw ramp Downward instead of Up for example
+ **Hz or Synced modes** - Synced mode from 128n up to 32 bars
  (actually more, see ModCycle below)
+ **Phase Retrigger** - Either free-running (Hz mode), transport-start synced
  (Synced mode), or Note-On (Hz or Synced modes)
  (this is why it is a MIDI Effect; Audio Effects cannot receive MIDI
  without sloppy workaround atm)
+ **Pulse Width** - Control of Square, or "Point Whereabouts" of Triangle
  waveform. PW is typical for the Square. PW for Triangle at 50% will produce...
  a triangle, with the point in the center. At 0% you will have a Saw ramping
  down; at 100% it will ramp up.
+ **ModCycle** - This is where L.LFO steps away from being a generic effect to
  an advanced (yet simple to use) modulation device. The same premise behind FM
  synthesis, or routing an LFO to itself, or routing another LFO to an LFO,
  is what's behind this. Modulate a carrier wave - the Shape parameter
  (Sine, Tri, Saw, Square) with a rate-multiplied Sine modulator (set by xRate).
  xRate = Global Rate * xRate. For example, if your Global Rate is set to 1n
  (1 bar), and your xRate is set to 8, you will have a greater modulation that
  cycles every 8 bars, with 1n modulations fading in and out accordingly.
  The xRate can also be smaller than the Global Rate (when xRate < 1.),
  creating sub-divisions that way. A waveform scope is included on the device to
  better aid using this option.
+ **SR (Sampling Rate) control** - The ultimate effect of
  this is like a Square wave version of ModCycle, though it works completely
  different, the end result in similar. The actual LFO engine is producing an
  audio-rate signal that is being sampled every 1 millisecond to produce usable
  control data. By making the SR slower, we are effectively applying a sort of
  bit reduction, adding tiny steps to our output waveform. The rate can be set in
  ms, or for more musical purposes it can be set in note-values just like the
  synced LFO. If you have a sine at 1n, and set the SR to 16n, you will have a
  downsampled sine wave modulation that only moves in 16n increments - very cool
  for musical purposes. All sorts of staircases can be made, though often phase
  cancelation can happen depending on your settings. Use this while in ModCycle
  mode extra crazy shapes!
+ **Other features** - Destination Min and Max, Instant mapping or List-browse
  mapping, very-low CPU consumption, very compact UI (so you can have like 5 of these side by side and still be able to see their settings). MIDI-to-CC. Info View help.
